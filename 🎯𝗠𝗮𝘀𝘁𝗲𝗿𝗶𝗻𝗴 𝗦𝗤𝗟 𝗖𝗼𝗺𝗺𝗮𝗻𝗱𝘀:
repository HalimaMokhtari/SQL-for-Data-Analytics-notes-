1.SQL “CREATE” command: used for creating tables, and databases.
syntax:
       CREATE  table table_name(
       column1 data type,
       column2 data type,
       ......);
Example: Let's create a table called customers, which stores simple information
about customers in an e-commerce scenario.
       CREATE TABLE customers (
       customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
       name VARCHAR(50),
       email VARCHAR(100),
       registration_date DATE
      );
2.SQL “INSERT” into command: used to insert new data into tables:
Syntax:
       INSERT into table name (column1, column2,...)
       VALUES(value1,value2,...);
Example:
Now, let's insert some sample data into the customers table.
        INSERT INTO customers (customer_id, name, email, registration_date)
        VALUES (1, 'Alice Johnson', 'alice@example.com', '2024-09-20'),
               (2, 'Bob Smith', 'bob@example.com', '2024-09-21'),
               (3, 'Charlie Brown', 'charlie@example.com', '2024-09-22');
3.SQL “SELECT” command: used to retrieve data from tables:
Syntax:
       SELECT column1, column2,...
       FROM table name;
To select the complete table, we use the asterisk sign(*)
        SELECT * FROM table name;
Example:
        SELECT * FROM customers;
**There is also the SQL SELECT DISTINCT command: used to return only unique
values from a specified column in a table.
Syntax:
         SELECT DISTINCT column_name
         FROM table name;
4.SQL “UPDATE” command: used to modify existing data in a table:
Syntax:
       UPDATE table name
       SET column_x=value_x,
       column_y=value_y,....
       WHERE column_z= value_z ;
Example: Let’s for example update Bob Smith’s email address:
        UPDATE customers
        SET email = 'bob.smith@example.com'
        WHERE customer_id = 2;
**”WHERE” used to filter records(rows) based on the given condition.
5.SQL “DELETE” command removes or deletes data from a table.
Syntax:
       DELETE FROM table name
       WHERE condition;
Example: Let’s say our customer Charlie Brown decided to delete his account, so
we can remove his record.
       DELETE FROM customers
       WHERE customer_id = 3;
##In Conclusion:
Mastering these essential SQL commands—CREATE, INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE,
and DELETE—is the foundation of working with databases. With these commands,
you can effectively manage data, ensuring your database is organized and up to
date.
