Before we get into SQL and MySQL, let’s take a step back and understand the foundation:
*𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚𝐛𝐚𝐬𝐞: A database is an organized collection of data so that it can be easily accessed. But how do we interact with databases? That’s where a 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚𝐛𝐚𝐬𝐞 𝐌𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐠𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐒𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐦 (𝐃𝐁𝐌𝐒) comes in! A 𝐃𝐁𝐌𝐒 is the software that allows us to create, manage, and operate databases. There are different types of DBMS, including:

*𝐑𝐞𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐃𝐁𝐌𝐒 (𝐑𝐃𝐁𝐌𝐒): Data stored in tables with relationships between them. Ex: 𝐌𝐲𝐒𝐐𝐋, 𝐒𝐐𝐋 𝐒𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐞𝐫, and 𝐏𝐨𝐬𝐭𝐠𝐫𝐞𝐒𝐐𝐋.

*𝗡𝗼𝗦𝗤𝗟 𝗗𝗕𝗠𝗦: For unstructured or semi-structured data. Ex: 𝗠𝗼𝗻𝗴𝗼𝗗𝗯 and 𝗖𝗮𝘀𝘀𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗿𝗮.

*𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭’𝐬 𝐒𝐐𝐋? It stands for structured query language, it’s used to 𝗜𝗡𝗦𝗘𝗥𝗧, 𝗨𝗣𝗗𝗔𝗧𝗘, and 𝗗𝗘𝗟𝗘𝗧𝗘 Data in a table or relational database.

*𝗦𝗤𝗟 𝗩𝗦 𝗠𝘆𝗦𝗤𝗟: SQL is a language used to perform 𝗖𝗥𝗨𝗗 (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in Relational DB, while MySQL is the RDBMS that uses SQL.

𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮𝗯𝗮𝘀𝗲𝘀 and 𝗗𝗕𝗠𝗦 are the foundation of data management, but this is just the beginning. Understanding how to interact with these systems is key, and that's where SQL comes in.

In the next post, we'll dive into SQL commands, starting with the essentials like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE—the core tools that will help you unlock the full potential of databases.
